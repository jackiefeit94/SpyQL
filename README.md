### Setup

To run SpyQL locally, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Fork and clone github repo
* npm install
* npm run seed
* npm run start-dev

(Note: running the game locally is not recommended due to random seeding; if you do want to play the full game on localhost, be sure to uncomment the console.log in the Table component and use your local database's tableId.)
